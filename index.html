            <ul>
              <p> 1.1 GILD is an acronym for Global Institute for Leadership Development and shall forthwith
                be the collective name of the intended body that seeks to coordinate and channel a
                worldwide network of theological institutions and individuals, which institutions and / or
                individuals operate mainly on, but not limited to, post-secondary education.</p>
              <p>
                1.2 GILD furthermore seeks to assist the Church, universally, by developing and empowering
                leaders through the provision of theological education.</p>
              <p>
                1.3 GILD seeks to create and facilitate further education, specifically for the development of
                leadership in the Church, through the creation and maintenance of an online distancelearning platform
                that
                will make accessible, necessary resources to all participating
                members.</p>
              <p> 1.4 This charter seeks to provide a body of substantive and formative principles that aim to
                bring about the fulfilment of the broad ideals stated in paragraph 1.1 and 1.2 above..</p>
              <p>
                1.5 In this Charter, any words purporting to be male shall, together with any necessary
                conforming changes, refer to the female as well and vice versa. Reference to words in the
                singular shall also have reference to such words in plural and vice versa.</p>
              <p>
                1.6 Words in this Charter are to be assigned their normal meaning, unless the context indicates
                otherwise.</p>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <h4><strong>2. MISSION AND VALUES
              </strong></h4>
            <ul>
              <p> 2.1 GILD is guided by the values based on the Triune God as contained in both the Old and
                the New Testaments and maintains that through the stated efforts embodied in this charter,
                Christian leadership and the Body of Christ is an instrument of God’s mission in this
                world. </p>
              <p>
                2.2 The Mission & Value Statement annexed to this Charter, and forming part of this Charter,
                sets out a detailed list of principles and directives which are to guide every facet of
                decision and policy making in GILD, to the extent that it is possible and expedient to do
                so.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.3 While acknowledging that cultural and ethnical differences have resulted in division and
                suffering, GILD believes that its members are united in Christ, who is the head of the
                Church, and that Christ has transformed such diversity into a strength and source of
                creativity.
              </p>
              <p> 2.4 GILD respects the theological autonomy of individual members, acknowledges the
                contributions of each member and as such cherishes collegiality, mutual respect,
                understanding, assistance, humility and openness in the interaction between members.</p>
              <p>
                2.5 As guided by the Mission & Value Statement, GILD shall at all times seek to be inclusive
                by promoting cooperation with other individuals, organisations, agencies and institutions
                (formal and informal) to the extent that such individuals, organisations, agencies and
                institutions (formal and informal) share in the principles contained in the Mission & Value
                Statement, and who are active in related fields.</p>
              <p>
                2.6 Resources entrusted to GILD will be used in a transparent and accountable manner.</p>
            </ul>


            <h4><strong>3. STATEMENT OF FAITH</strong></h4>
            <p>GILD believes:</p>
            <ul>
              <p>3.1 in the sovereignty and grace of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit in
                creation, providence, redemption and final judgment; </p>
              <p>
                3.2 in the divine inspiration of the Holy Scripture and its consequent, entire trustworthiness
                and supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct;
              </p>
              <p>
                3.3 that human beings are made in the image of God and are created to love, serve, worship
                and enjoy God and are entrusted with stewardship of God’s creation;

              </p>
              <p> 3.4 in the universal sinfulness and guilt of humanity, making people subject to God’s wrath
                and condemnation;
              </p>
              <p>
                3.6 in the justification of the sinner solely by the grace of God through faith in Christ crucified
                and risen from the dead;

              </p>
              <p>
                3.7 in the illuminating, regenerating, indwelling, sanctifying and empowering work of God
                the Holy Spirit;

              </p>
              <p>
                3.8 in the priesthood of all believers, who form the universal Church, the body of which Christ
                is the Head, committed by His command to the proclamation and demonstration of the
                Gospel throughout the world;

              </p>
              <p>
                3.9 in the personal, visible return of the Lord Jesus Christ in power and glory.</p>
